# MedFlow

This project is a compressive manned by four individuals specialising in design and full-stack development. For this project, we use the following languages: HTML/CSS and JavaScript for the front end, PHP for the back end, and MySQL for our database.

The team comprises Kevin Kewku Cudjoe, Jonathan Kweku Boateng, Bless Charles Oppong and Baaba Onomaa Amosah. The problem statement is as follows: Many healthcare institutions rely on outdated or manual systems for managing their operations, leading to administrative errors, delays in patient care, and mismanagement of inventory. The lack of integration between departments also causes bottlenecks that affect hospital performance and patient satisfaction.

Hence, our solution is MedFlow. MedFlow is developed to address these challenges by unifying all hospital functions under one platform. It provides real-time patient management, staff scheduling, inventory tracking, and analytics, ensuring hospitals remain efficient, secure, and compliant with healthcare regulations.
